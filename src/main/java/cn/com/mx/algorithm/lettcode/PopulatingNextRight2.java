/**
 * Follow up for problem "Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node".
 * <p>
 * What if the given tree could be any binary tree? Would your previous solution still work?
 * <p>
 * Note:
 * <p>
 * You may only use constant extra space.
 * For example,
 * Given the following binary tree,
 * |      1
 * |    /  \
 * |   2    3
 * |  / \    \
 * | 4   5    7
 * After calling your function, the tree should look like:
 * |      1 -> NULL
 * |    /  \
 * |   2 -> 3 -> NULL
 * |  / \    \
 * | 4-> 5 -> 7 -> NULL
