/**
 * Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function
 * to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.
 * <p>
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]], return true.
 * <p>
 * Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]], return false.
 * <p>
 * Hint:
 * <p>
 * Given n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]], what should your return? Is this case a valid tree?
 * According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected graph in which any two vertices are
 * connected by exactly one path. In other words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
 * Note: you can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same
 * as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

     * What is the difference between tree and graph?
     * Tree is a special graph: 1) All connected. 2) No cycle. Connected acyclic graph.
     * Union-find can be used to build connected component and check connection.
     * <p>
     * Implementation:
     * Quick check: It requires n-1 edges to connect n vertices. So if edges.length != n-1, return false.
     * Initialize an array of connected component ids.
     * For each edge in edges:
     * | Find the connected component ids for the two nodes.
     * | If the ids are the same, the two nodes are already connected, return false.
     * | Else, union the two nodes by set x's id to y.
     * After checking all edges, return true.
