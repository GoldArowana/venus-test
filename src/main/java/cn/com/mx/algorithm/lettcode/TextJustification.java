/**
 * Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully
 * (left and right) justified.
 * <p>
 * You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra
 * spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.
 * <p>
 * Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not
 * divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
 * <p>
 * For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
 * <p>
 * For example,
 * words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
 * L: 16.
 * <p>
 * Return the formatted lines as:
 * [
 * "This    is    an",
 * "example  of text",
 * "justification.  "
 * ]
 * Note: Each word is guaranteed not to exceed L in length.
 * <p>
 * Corner Cases:
 * A line other than the last line might contain only one word. What should you do in this case?
 * In this case, that line should be left-justified.
